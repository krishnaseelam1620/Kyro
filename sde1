SDE 1 Questions
1 how familiar in data structures and array stacks
Ans- 4 out of 5

2 what is the use in data structures in extract 
ans- In extract we get unstrutured or poorly strutured data , with help of data structure we can store and access data efficiently.

3 what kind of data structures in upstracts
Ans- 

4 what is the terms of storing data in array list
Ans- we can store homogenous data in array in continuous memory location usng indexing .


5 arrays and list definition? which is suitable?
Ans-  arrays is data structure used to store homogenous data 
      lists is a data structre used to store heterogenous data
      lists atre suitable in most cases
      
6 what is the negative index in arrays?
Ans - with negative indexing we can access value from the end
    eg:a=[1,2,3,4,5]
    a[-1]=5
    a[-2]=4
    a[-i]=a[n-i-1]
    
7 why do you prefer list always instead of using arrays
Ans- Lists can easily grow in size, and you can add and remove elements in the middle of the list easily. That cannot be done with arrays. and in array we are not
able to store heterogenous data but in lists we can store heterogenous data


8 is array storing in homogenous?
 ans- arrays always store homogeneous data and we need to store homogeneous data.

9 where do you store in hetrogenous?
Ans- we can store in lists

10 where do you use array?
Ans- to store a collection of homogenous data

11 what about stack circuits?
Ans - we can construct circuits using stacks.

12 what is diff btw array &array list
Ans - Lists can easily grow in size, and you can add and remove elements in the middle of the list easily. That cannot be done with arrays. and in array we are not
able to store heterogenous data but in lists we can store heterogenous data



13 collection of frame what does it concern
Ans- like collection of data we can store frames using datastructures

14 types of list in array list
Ans - single linked lists
      double linked lists
      circular linked lists
      multiple linked lists

15 what about advantages of map
Ans - stores the data in form of key-value pair

16 why find an element in map is fast
Ans- since we are stroing the data in  key-value pair we can access the value in o(1) using key.

17 can array list can be an index
Ans - Yes we can use array list as a key(index) in map 

18 what types of list in array we have in data structures
Ans- 1d,2d,multi dimensional array

19 advantages of pvs&essential items
Ans- 




1 find the third largest element in a intergrated array?
approach: basically i used maxheap concept to get it done in o(n) time complexity and o(n) space comlexity , i can do it in o(nlogn) time with O(1) space complexity
by sorting the array using best sorting algorithm 

import heapq as h
arr = [12, 3, 5, 7, 19]
k = 3
h._max_heapify(arr)
for i in range(k):
  ele=h.heappop(arr)
print("kth largest element:",ele)
  




2 reverse the array into subarrays by considering the intern 'n' given

approach: for every n elements in arr i called reverse function with mentionning start-index and end_index 
it will reverse only elements within those indexes and returns same array


def reverse(arr,s,e):
	if e>len(arr):
		e=len(arr)-1
	while s<e:
		arr[s],arr[e]=arr[e],arr[s]
		s+=1
		e-+1
	return arr
arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
len=len(arr)
n=2
for i in range(0,len,n):
	arr=reverse(arr,i,i+n)
